# Limitations

### Normal user:
- Creating an account via signup creates a "normal user"
- Presentations have a limit of 10 pieces of media
- Media size is limited to 1Mb maximum

### Admin:
- Admin has the power to:
    - Delete normal users
    - View and delete media/presentations of all users
    - Assign admin powers to normal users
- Admin users have no media limit in presentations

### Technical limitations:
- As of now, team Muvico does not recommend uploading media which exceeds the filesize of 100Mb. This, in the worst scenario, may break the server.
