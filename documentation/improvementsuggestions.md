# Future Improvement Suggestions

#### **Diversify Media Content:**

- Expand the variety of supported video files. This will enrich the user experience and provide more flexibility.

#### **Enable Lyrics Addition:**

- Explore the possibility of allowing users to add lyrics to the platform. Consider leveraging Musixmatch API to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the lyrics. This will enrich the content available on the platform and provide users with additional value.

#### **Expand number of outputs:**

- Right now the screen capacity is limited at 4 screens. Explore different options for expanding this capacity.

### **Introduce effect features**

- Effects could be both audio and visual, such as sound- and transition effects to enrich the user experience.

### **Random element**

- Introduce a new type of element which contains a pool of media that gets displayed randomly for the duration of the element. This makes it easier for the user to generate bigger presentations where the order of the media isn't relevant.
